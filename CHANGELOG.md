# CHANGELOG

## v0.19.0 (2024-07-11)

- Adds new `formula_includes` parameter to allow including items in the built formula
  - eg: including a Python virtual environment, see the [Python Docs](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Python-for-Formula-Authors.md) for more details

## v0.18.3 (2024-07-07)

- Corrects regression introduced in `v0.18.2` on the URLs used for public repo asset downloads
- Removes the quotes that previously wrapped commit messages unintentionally
  - Uses a conventional commit message structure
- Bumps development dependencies

## v0.18.2 (2024-07-04)

**WARNING: Do not use this version, please use v0.18.3 or later!**

- Fixes the URLs used to download the default zip/tars for private repos

## v0.18.1 (2024-01-12)

- Corrects order of `version` definition in formula generation to satisfy the ever-changing Homebrew audit rules

## v0.18.0 (2023-12-12)

- Adds a `version` parameter which can override the automatically detected version of a formula with an explicit value

## v0.17.0 (2023-10-26)

- Upgrades from Python 3.11 to Python 3.12
- Corrects `/archive` URLs to the new `/archive/refs/tags` URLs to satisfy `brew audit`

## v0.16.7 (2023-05-24)

- Only strips the leading `v` from the version string instead of replacing all `v`s with nothing so versions such as `v0.1.0.dev0` can be picked up

## v0.16.6 (2023-04-20)

- Enables typing in generated formula to appease `brew audit`

## v0.16.5 (2023-03-23)

- Fixes a bug that wouldn't build formula when no assets were present

## v0.16.4 (2023-03-20)

- Writes checksum file once instead of appending for each
- Better assignment of autogenerated_tar_archive checksum by always taking the first index instead of doing a check

## v0.16.3 (2023-03-16)

- Refactors git subprocess error handling
  - Sends `stderr` to `stdout` and captures the subprocess error output as text (previously got clobbered)
  - Returns stack trace
  - Use new helper function to keep all git calls uniform
  - More appropriate error logging and capture
  - Better tests surrounding subprocesses
- When updating a README table, we now only `git add` once instead of twice
- Even if you specify `skip_commit`, we will now run `git commit` but will continue to skip the `git push`, this will ensure a more complete dry-run and will help debug committing issues since it now can commit safely without updating a remote repo

## v0.16.2 (2023-03-15)

- Fixes a packaging issue with v0.16.1

## v0.16.1 (2023-03-15)

- Use `x-access-token` as Username when authenticating for git clone and push operations which should allow password to explicitly be stored in the correct field
- Adds a `30 second` timeout to all HTTP requests (previously could run forever)

## v0.16.0 (2023-03-03)

- Adds `download_strategy` input to define a custom Homebrew download strategy for your formula
- Adds `custom_require` input to define a custom `relative_require` in the formula template
- Fixes a bug where the browser URL was used to download assets instead of the asset URL which wasn't accessible by private repos
- Fixes a spacing issue in formula templates when only one architecture is specified for each OS
- Instead of retrieving a list of all tags and then grabbing the most recent one, we grab the latest release and grab the tag from it. Most workflows should continue to work as expected if you were cutting GitHub releases; however, if you were using this action without using GitHub releases and only using git tags, you will need to start using releases per the README. This change was necessary to get asset URLs working along with bringing the expectation more inline with what the docs suggested in the README. This should also slightly improve performance for repos with many tags since the response from GitHub will be much smaller

## v0.15.0 (2023-02-28)

- Add support for private repos by using the already existing `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var available to GitHub Actions to make authenticated HTTP requests to the GitHub API instead of the previously unauthenticated requests

## v0.14.3 (2023-01-31)

- Bumps image from Python 3.10 to 3.11
- Strips formula name from description on generated formula to be compliant with `brew audit`
- No longer populates an empty `license` field when one is not provided, uses `NA` for `desc` when one is not provided to be compliant with `brew audit`
- Bumps test dependencies

## v0.14.2 (2022-11-28)

- Adds a missing newline after replacing the README table if elected

## v0.14.1 (2022-09-18)

- Fixes an ommission of start/end tags on the replacement README table

## v0.14.0 (2022-09-18)

- Fixes a bug that wouldn't update a README table if there was no content between the start and end tags
- README filename determination is much more robust allowing for alternative filename casing
- Added error handling for formula directories that do not contain any Ruby files
- Comprehensive, 100% test coverage for the `update_readme` module
- Added `bandit` for security scanning and added new `isort` config

## v0.13.3 (2022-09-14)

- Fixes a bug that would replace the README table start/end tags when replacing the content of a table. Now the tags will remain while the table content itself will get updated

## v0.13.2 (2022-09-13)

- Fixes a bug that wouldn't generate the README table correctly even when the start and end tags were found
- Fixes a bug where the README table could be updated even if there was no end tag, effectively replacing the remaining content after a start tag in your README

## v0.13.1 (2022-09-12)

- Fixes a bug that would attempt to generate an updated README table even if it could not find the old table location to replace it (closes #19)

## v0.13.0 (2022-09-12)

- Fixes a bug where `false` booleans in the GitHub Actions configuration would still pass through truthy. This is because GitHub Actions passes all env vars to the action as a string. We simply check for false strings and coerce them to False bools now (closes #16)
- Fixes a bug that would kill the action when no `license` or `description` was set on a repo (closes #17)
- Fixes an error where a few variables were referenced before assignment due to some nested if statements in README generation (closes #18)

- Generates a checksum for the auto-generate `.zip` release archive in addition the auto-generated `.tar.gz` archive
- Adds better error handling for HTTP errors
- Completely overhauls the formula templating engine allowing for easy future additions if necessary

## v0.11.0 (2022-01-08)

- Added the `depends_on` key to formulas allowing users to specify dependencies for their formulas
- Reworked formula generation logic and tests to be more accurate and explicit for better formula generation (we now audit the test formula on CI)

## v0.10.0 (2021-12-12)

- Adds a `checksum.txt` file to the latest release of your repo containing the checksums of all "released" assets (binaries, scripts, etc)
- Bumps minimum version of Python from 3.7 to 3.9

## v0.9.2 (2021-12-07)

- Adds `mypy` type checking

## v0.9.1 (2021-11-24)

- Restores previous logger formatting for console output

## v0.9.0 (2021-11-24)

- Fixes a bug that setup the git environment incorrectly after the shell refactor from the last release

## v0.8.2 (2021-11-02)

- Refactors shell operations to no longer invoke a shell when using the subprocess module. No longer change directories but instead call git operations directly from the destination path

## v0.8.1 (2021-10-25)

- Removes the `bottle :unneeded` from formula generation as it's been deprecated

## v0.8.0 (2021-09-10)

- Rebuild with the corrected `pretty-tables` library which re-adds the horizontal break between headers and row data
- Removes the `mock` library in favor of the builtin `unittest.mock` library
- Bumps the minimum Python version to 3.7

## v0.7.0 (2021-06-27)

- Refactored app completely by splitting up all logic into separate modules
- We now use the latest tag instead of release as releases can often be named instead of sticking to strict version numbers (closes #4, closes #7)
- Adds `an` to the list of articles to strip out of formula descriptions
- Changed `Installation` header in README updater to `Install`
- Added better error handling surrounding the README updater
- Exposed `DEBUG` logging to the user via the `debug: true` flag to assist in troubleshooting the GitHub Action if necessary
- Made all functions static methods
- Added better test coverage
- Split up git `add`, `commit`, and `push` functionality for better flexibilty
- Additional info and debugging statements for each step were added
- Various small improvements and bug fixes

## v0.6.0 (2021-05-31)

- Drops the clone depth of a repo from `5` to `2`
- Changes the git config from a global scope to local scope (helps during testing by not accidentally blowing away real credentials)
- Various code refactor

## v0.4.3 (2021-02-01)

- Added automated releasing (retagging) of Homebrew Releaser via GitHub Actions. When a new version is released, GitHub Actions will automatically update the stable `v1` tag to point to the latest release

## v0.4.1 && v0.4.2 (2021-01-09)

- Small bug fix that sets the default formula folder

## v0.4.0 (2021-01-09)

- Overhauled the configurable options and provided more defaults out of the box. Changes include:
  - No longer support `owner` and `repo` as these variables are given to use by GitHub already
  - Changed `homebrew_formula_folder` to `formula_folder` - added a default of `formula`
  - Changed `owner_email` to `commit_email` and added `commit_owner` - added defaults of `homebrew-releaser@example.com` and `homebrew-releaser` respectively

- Updated documentation with all changes
- Cut out extra overhead on the Dockerfile to improve performance
- Properly format `desc` field to pass `brew audit` by stripping articles from the beginning if present and hard stops from the end (all periods and exclamations)
- Added additional logging for `info` and `debug` modes and fixed a typo in the output
- Added an optional env variable `skip_commit` which will skip committing the generated formula to a homebrew tap. Useful for local testing

## v0.3.0 (2021-01-06)

- Fixes `brew audit` lint rules by adding an extra line between magic comments and adding missing `typed: false` comment
- Added the `logging` module and replaced print statements
- 100% code coverage

- Important bug fix required to get Homebrew Releaser running
- More unit tests

## v0.2.0 (2021-01-05)

- Changed name from `shell-releaser` to `homebrew-releaser` as this tool can really be used for any kind of script, binary, or executable
- Changed env variable of `bin_install` to simply `install` as you may not need/want to place your scripts in bin and use `system` instead
- Switch from `python-3.9` to `python3.9-alpine` Docker image for much faster performance. Manually install `git` and `perl-utils` in Docker image as we depend on them for correct operation
